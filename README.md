# Data-science-and-machine-learning---UCL

**Description:** Contains projects completed for my MSc Data Science and Machine Learning at UCL.

## Drought_latest

•	In this project we use data from the US drought monitor website which was downloaded from kaggle [1]. The data set was manually created and contains many geographical features that can be used to predict drought. Ultimately, the goal is to generalize these predictions of drought in the US to other regions of the world.

•	We train models which include logistic regression, random forest, KNN, decision tree and XGBoost. Then I demonstrate that a stacked model using the random forest, KNN, decision tree and logistic regression outperform the current baseline models. 

## practicalMixGauss_Apples_Final_check

•	In this project a classifier is created from scratch to find apple and non-apple pixels in images using a mixture of gaussians. 

## Homographies

•	This folder contains various projects that tackle different problems in the field of homography. These include calculating homographies, forming panoramic images and tracking pixels in multiple images.
